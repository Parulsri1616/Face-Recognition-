# Face-Recognition-
This project demonstrates a face recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. It includes steps for capturing face images, training a custom face recognizer, and real-time face detection using a webcam — all developed and tested inside a Jupyter Notebook environment.


📁 Features
📸 Image Dataset Collection: Capture face images through webcam and save them in labeled format.
🧠 Model Training: Train the LBPH face recognizer on grayscale images of faces.
🎯 Face Recognition: Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV.
💾 Model Saving: Save and reuse the trained model (classifier.xml) without retraining.
📊 Simple, Clean Code: Jupyter Notebook format for clarity and step-by-step execution.
