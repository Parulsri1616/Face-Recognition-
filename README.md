# Face-Recognition-
This project demonstrates a face recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. It includes steps for capturing face images, training a custom face recognizer, and real-time face detection using a webcam â€” all developed and tested inside a Jupyter Notebook environment.
